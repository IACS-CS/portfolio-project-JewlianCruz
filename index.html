          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            I am from Lowell, Massachusetts, and I will be 18 on January 28th, 2025. 
            I enjoy putting my skills into things I'm not familiar with, like this project. 
            My goal is to show my talents by coding this project the way I want it, showcasing some code I've done previously.
            Some intresting things about me; I have a strong passion to become a electrician and eventually go to trade school
            in August 2025, and learn to work for 4 years. After I get my certifcate my plan is to become a licensed 
            independent contractor and or a journeyman electrician. Some other cool hobbies I enjoy is boxing, I've been a fan
            of this sport since I was 3 years old. Actually there is a video of me on youtube fighting with my stepfather in the ring: 
            search up Jewlian Gendron and Cariana Gendron: Cariana is my older sister. Boxing has been a passion of mine for a long time, 
            I have boxed for 5 years and so gratful to understand and know the fundementals; dream was to become a professional boxer, but
            thats okay, I still love it. As a growing adult I plan to work closer to become a man for myself and for my family, I plan to
            grow my knowledge to a very high standered to become the man I've dreamed to be. My plan for 2025 is to work as much as I can
            as a 17 year old, and save as much as I can for a reliable car; luckily I do feel blessed to have to work for my own things like 
            this because it teaches me to work harder for my desires. Once I get this car and once I recieve my diploma, I'll go to trade
            school, and by late 2026-2027, I would love to have my own home, with my future wife Adriana Romero, and our future dogs. I'm a 
            young man who had to teach himself to become a man, a young man who didn't have a male figure to look up too. This motivates me 
            to become something, to be looked as a independent hard working male. After all, I won't recieve this without God and Jesus Christ, 
            my goal and desire before any of these wants, is to build a relationship with both and live in his name, after all I will leave this earth
            with nothing but my relationship with the LORD. Thank you for listening!

            <h3>Tyng Mansion Story</h3>
            <p>In this project, I had to create my own story using two elements, I've learned in class
              to create anticipation and fear. In the project we had to create a writing project, of my own
              knowledge with real facts from the history of our town and school to create an original short 
              story about the ghosts of IACS.

            <h3>Zen Garden Project</h3>
            <p>Inspired by David Shea's CSS Zen Garden, this project was to challenge us to create one design only using CSS while leaving HTML untouched.
              My goal was to be able to show my creative power of CSS by designing a beautiful layout and a theme of my choice. 
              In the project, you explore how to use color, layout techniques, and images to highlight your skills to craft engaging styles. </p>
