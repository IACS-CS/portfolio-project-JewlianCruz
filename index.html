          <p>
            I am from Lowell, Massachusetts, and I will be 18 on January 28th, 2025. 
            I enjoy putting my skills into things I'm not familiar with; such as 
            this project. My goal is to show my talents by coding this project the way
            I want it, showcasing some code I've done previously.

          <h3>Zen Garden Project</h3>
          <p>Inspired by David Shea's CSS Zen Garden, this project was to challenge us to create one design only using CSS while leaving HTML untouched.
             My goal was to be able to show my creative power of CSS by designing a beautiful layout and a theme of my choice. 
            In the project, you explore how to use color, layout techniques, and images to highlight your skills to craft engaging styles.
